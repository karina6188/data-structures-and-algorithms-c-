## About This Program
Challenge - Breadth First Traversal on Graph

Author: Karina Chen

## Description
This is a daily code challenges. The task is to create a method called BreadthFirst() that traverses through a graph using breadth-first traversal. Multiple methods will be required to support and implement a graph. Inside the graph, there should be vertices containing values. The vertices are connected with each other directly or undirected with weight on each edge.
 
## Approach & Efficiency
##### BreadthFirst():


##### AddVertex():


##### Size():


##### GetAllVertices():


##### GetNeighbors():


##### AddDirectedEdge():


##### AddUndirectedEdge():


##### Print():


##### Time and Space Complexity:
