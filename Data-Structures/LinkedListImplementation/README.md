## About This Program
Data Structure and Algorithm

Author: Karina Chen

## Description
This is a data structure and algorithm challenge associated with Linked List Implementation.

Three methods are demonstrated in this program:

insert(): takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

includes(): takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.

toString(): takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List.
