## Description
This is a daily code challenges project that includes various challenges. See Table of Contents above.

Challenge 02 - Binary Search: The function called BinarySearch takes in an array and a search key and start at the midpoint of the array to look for the key. If midpoint is greater than the key, go to the first half of the array and set the current midpoint to be the new end point and set a new midpoint then compare the values again. Repeat this process until the key value is found or break out the while loop when reaching to the beginning or the end of the array.

If the key value is found, return the index position of the value. If not found, return -1.
