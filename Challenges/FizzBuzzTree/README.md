Challenge - Fizz Buzz Tree

Author: Karina Chen

## Description
This is a daily code challenges. The task is to traverse through a binary tree and if a node's value is divisible by 3, 5, or both, replace the value with "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz". At the end, return the tree with its new values.
